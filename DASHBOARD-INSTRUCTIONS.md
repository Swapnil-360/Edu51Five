-- Since we can't modify storage.objects via SQL, 
-- we need to use the Supabase Dashboard instead.
-- 
-- DASHBOARD STEPS:
-- 1. Go to Supabase Dashboard
-- 2. Click "Storage" in left sidebar
-- 3. Find your "materials" bucket
-- 4. Click on the bucket name
-- 5. Go to "Configuration" or "Settings" tab
-- 6. Look for "Row Level Security" or "Public Access"
-- 7. Either disable RLS or make bucket fully public
--
-- OR try creating storage policies via Dashboard:
-- Go to Storage > Policies and create a new policy

-- Alternative: Test with a video URL first (no file upload needed)
-- This will test if the database insert works without storage
